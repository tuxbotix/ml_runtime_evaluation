## Background

* In 2017-2018 - we started using Neural Networks on the NAO
    * We had handwritten code to perform the inference!
* OpenCV was one of the earliest inference oriented backends we used
* Later, we and many SPL teams use CompiledNN
* TensorFlow Lite is one of the earliest available choices.

## Present day situation!

There are *many* libraries, toolchains and ecosystems targetting embedded NN inference

i.e.:
* TensorFlow Lite
* Apache TVM (compiles to different tagets, LLVM-IR, TensorRT, etc)
* MLIR
* Tract (a pure Rust library)

## What were tested

* TensorFlow Lite
* Tract
* CompiledNN (baseline)

## Steps

Small repo with a few things, C++ code is WIP (to compare against Rust bindings).
More will be added soon!

https://github.com/tuxbotix/ml_runtime_evaluation

```bash
git clone git@github.com:tuxbotix/ml_runtime_evaluation.git
cd ml_runtime_evaluation

# Rust
cd rust

cargo build

cargo bench
```

## How about running on a NAO?

I tested this out with the HULKs Yocto SDK. See HULKs code release and yesterday's talk on Yocto for more info.

```bash
source ~/.naosdk/5.0/environment-setup-corei7-64-aldebaran-linux

# This will make target/x86_64-aldebaran-linux-gnu/.. (debug)
cargo build

# Build the benchmarks
cargo bench

# Copy via SSH to the NAO
# run the benchmark executable.
```

## What are the numbers?

On a Thinkpad T490:

```bash
cargo bench

...
